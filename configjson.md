## How to fill in config.json
`config.json` file is auto generated at first launch with a template.
You must configure it with two important values:

1- **fooocus-directory** contains the full path of your Fooocus installation
Note that you MUST double the `\\` in each folder

2- **fooocus-address** contains the http address of Fooocus web UI.
By default, the address is "127.0.0.1:7865" and should work

**You must restart FoooXus app to take into account these file updates**

The next part of `config.json` file is dedicated to illustration presets.
See [this document to manage your illustration presets](configpreset.md).
