## How to install the standalone FoooXus executable

You can download the last release of foooxus.zip. 
Because the file contains all the necessary modules, it is very heavy (about 3GB)

1 Move it on the folder you like (Desktop, Documents, whatever...)

2 Unzip it

3 Double-click on `start-foooxus.bat`

4 Some folders are created

5 A new `config.json` is created

Fill in the **fooocus-directory** and **fooocus-address** values

Read this document about [general configuration](configjson.md) for more informations

6 re-start `start-foooxus.bat` and open your browser on http://127.0.0.1:7878 to view FoooXus UI


Note that the .exe usage is only created to users that are not fluent with terminal commands.

The `foooxus.exe` can take more than 20 seconds to start. Be patient.
